# odin-google-clone
The Odin Project Assignment

### Goal: create as close a clone as possible of the Google search homepage.

TODO:
- [x] Get the general layout of the elements
- [x] Add, style icons (GApps icon, User icon)
- [x] Add search bar
- [x] Position search bar
- [x] Style search bar
- [x] Change color of search icon
- [ ] Fix the broken right end of search bar
- [ ] Final tweaks

Update 7/1: I think I'm going to move on for now. It's quite close, but I'm having problems with the user icon hover and the right end of the search bar.

Final tweaks will include: adjusting positioning, padding/spacing of any items that are off, adding a title/(favicon maybe).
